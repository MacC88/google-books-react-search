# google-books-react-search

In this assignment we were to create a react app and use google book api to search for any book in their database and than save it using MongoDB. You also need to be able to delete a saved book and also follow a link that brings you to another page were you can preview the book that you searched for.

I was unable to upload the app on Heroku, so i took some snapshots showing that the app works locally on my machine. They are located under the snapshot folder.
